Village of Lies
----------------

![Liar!](http://www.resumetarget.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/resume-lies1.jpg)

     villageA
     (Truth)
                  man(B): A
                  man(A): A
                    
     villageB
     (Lies)

###Which village tells the truth?

####Our hero asks the villager: which village are you from?

>Two villages
>>Village A
>>>Everyone here tells *the truth*

>>Village B
>>>Everyone here *lies*

Let's say the man is from Village B, so he **always lies**. When our hero asks him "Where are you from?" the man **will lie**, and say "Village A."

If, however, the man is from Village A **he will respond truthfully**, and reply "Village A."

Either way, our hero will be pointed in the direction of the town where everyone tells the truth.

A great day of business is bound to follow $$$.

| Man is From... | He will... | Answer Response... |
| -------------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| Village of Lies| Lie | "I am from Village of Truth" |
| Village of Truth| Tell truth | "I am from Village of Truth" |

Paiting of Mystery
-------------------

A man walks into an art gallery and concentrates on one picture in particular. The museum curator notices this and asks the man why he is so interested in that one painting. The man replies, "Brothers and sisters have I none, but that man's father is my father's son."

Who is in the painting?

>Man
>>Man in Painting
>>>Man in Painting's Father

> + Man's Father's Son = Man
> + Man in Painting's Father = Man
> + Man in Paiting = Man's Son


| Question Phrasing | Translation |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| my father's son | man |
