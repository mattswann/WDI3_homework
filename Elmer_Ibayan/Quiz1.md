####Warm up One.
A traveller comes to a fork in the road which leads to two villages. In one village the people always tell lies, and in the other village the people always tell the truth. The traveller needs to conduct business in the village where everyone tells the truth. A man from one of the villages is standing in the middle of the fork, but there is no indication of which village he is from. The traveller approaches the man and asks him one question. From the villager's answer, he knows which road to follow. What did the traveller ask?

#####Answer:
*He will ask: "which road goes to your village?". He would then take the route the person pointed to. The truthful peson, would point to  his village, the truth village, right? Also, the liar would point to the truth village, the same village because he can't tell the truth. So, if the traveller wants to go the truth village, he knows which road to take.*


####Warm up Two.
A man walks into an art gallery and concentrates on one picture in particular. The museum curator notices this and asks the man why he is so interested in that one painting. The man replies, "Brothers and sisters have I none, but that man's father is my father's son."

Who is in the painting?

#####Answer:
*The man in the picture is his son. Since he doesn’t have any brothers or sisters, the statement my father’s son is himself. A shortened version would be this man’s father is myself, so he is the father of the man in the picture.*

####Warm up four.
A man has to get a fox, a chicken, and a sack of corn across a river. He has a row boat, and it can only carry him and one other thing. If the fox and the chicken are left together, the fox will eat the chicken. If the chicken and the corn are left together, the chicken will eat the corn. How does the man do it?

#####Answer:
1. *The man and the chicken cross the river, (the fox and corn are safe together), he leaves the chicken on the other side and goes back across.*

2. *The man then takes the fox across the river, and since he can't leave the fox and chicken together, he brings the chicken back.*

3. *Again, since the chicken and corn can't be left together, he leaves the chicken and he takes the corn across and leaves it with the fox.*

4. *He then returns to pick up the chicken and heads across the river one last time.*
